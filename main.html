   var currentTime = new Date();
   var hours = currentTime.getHours();

   if (hours >= 0 && hours < 12) {

      window.location = "morning.html";
   } else if (hours >= 12 && hours < 18) {

This code defines a JavaScript function called displayTimeOfDayPage() that uses the Date object to get the current time and the window.location property to redirect 
the user to a different page depending on the time of day. The function checks the value of the hours variable, which represents the current hour in the 24-hour time 
format, and redirects the user to a different page depending on whether it is morning, afternoon, or evening. You can customize this code to display different pages 
and adjust the time ranges as needed. Additionally, you can call this function when the page loads or when a specific event occurs, such as when the user clicks a 
button or links to a page.

<html>
   <head>
      <title>My Time-Based Website</title>
   </head>
   <body onload="displayTimeOfDayPage()">
      <h1>Welcome to My Time-Based Website!</h1>
      <p>This website displays different content depending on the time of day. When you load this page, the time of day will be detected and you will be redirected 
      to the appropriate page.</p>
   </body>
</html>

This code adds the onload="displayTimeOfDayPage()" attribute to the <body> element of the HTML page. This specifies that the displayTimeOfDayPage() function should 
be called when the page loads. The function will then execute and redirect the user to the appropriate page based on the time of day. You can customize this code to 
call other functions or to add more content and features to your HTML page.
